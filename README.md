## Overview
**PumpUSD (PUSD)** is a research-focused stablecoin protocol that lets users mint **PUSD** by depositing approved collateral into on-chain vaults.  
The system is designed to be transparent, modular, and governed on-chain.  

PUSD is intended as a **decentralized primitive for trading, DeFi applications, and payment rails** within the Solana ecosystem.

## Design Goals
- 💵 **Pegged** — soft peg to USD via over-collateralization  
- 🔍 **Transparent** — all reserves and liabilities on-chain and verifiable  
- 🧩 **Modular** — multi-collateral support with interchangeable oracles  
- 🛡️ **Resilient** — liquidations and circuit breakers prevent runaway risk  
- 🔗 **Composable** — designed to integrate with Solana DeFi protocols  

---

## Architecture
- **PUSD Mint** — SPL Token (Token-2022) controlled by the protocol  
- **Collateral Vaults** — token accounts owned by the program for each supported asset  
- **Oracle Adapters** — integrates Pyth/Switchboard for secure price feeds  
- **Liquidation Engine** — keeper-driven auctions for under-collateralized positions  
- **Governance Layer** — multisig/timelock controls parameter updates  


---

## Key Features
- 🪙 Over-collateralized minting (deposit wSOL/USDC to mint PUSD)  
- 🔒 Health factor checks on every vault  
- ⚡ Fast liquidations with keeper incentives  
- 📊 Global debt ceilings and per-collateral caps  
- ⏸️ Emergency pause switches with timelocks
